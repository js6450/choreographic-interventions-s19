# Choreographic Interventions Syllabus - Spring 2019

- Spring 2019, Fridays, 3:20PM-6:15PM in Room 50
- Schedule for [Barnard/Columbia Students](https://github.com/mimiyin/choreographic-interventions-s19/wiki/Class-Dates-and-Times-for-Barnard-Columbia-Students)
- We will be making weekly field trips to the dance studio @NYU's Center for Ballet and The Arts [@20 Cooper Square](https://www.google.com/maps/place/20+Cooper+Sq,+New+York,+NY+10003/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c2599b1f6830c9:0x59c76513472fc813?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiOt_7-n-3dAhVCh-AKHVM5BJIQ8gEwAHoECAAQAQ)
- Instructors: Mimi Yin, mimi.yin@nyu.edu, Kat Sullivan, kat.sullivan@nyu.edu
- [Office Hours Signup](https://itp.nyu.edu/inwiki/Signup/Mimi)

### Course Structure | [See introductory description below.](#course-description)

Over the course of the semester, we will cover 3 topic areas that correspond to 3 parameters of choreography: Pathways, The Body (Form + Substance) and Space. Topics will be introduced through movement-based improvisation exercises. Computational strategies will be examined through code examples. For each topic, students will create small movement studies with the aim of fully exploring how technology "intervenes" and changes the choreographic process.

The class will culminate in a showing of student work. Final projects can either be in the form of an interactive installation or live performance.

This class runs in conjunction with a course in the Barnard/Columbia Dance Department and will comprise of students from both NYU and Barnard/Columbia. All classes will take place @NYU. Most weeks, the last hour of each class will be devoted to a separate technical lab for ITP students only.

Because course topics are organized around movement concepts, technical topics will be introduced and built upon week to week.
- What do cameras see? What don't they see?
- Skeletons, Depth Maps and Contours
- 2D v. 3D
- Mapping values
- Working with position versus velocity of movement
- Position tracking
- 2D Projection mapping
- Computational approaches to choreographing pathways of motion
- Computational approaches to dividing and defining space
- Modes of interaction

"Soft Skills" we will practice:
- Sketching (as in drawing on paper) choreographic ideas.
- Defining rule sets for movement.
- Defining rules of interaction.
- Deconstructing choreography into parameters for code.
- Extracting choreographic ideas from code.

## Project Development: Weeks 9, 10, 11

### Assignment: Playground
   * Create a space to interact with as the first step towards your final project.

Over the next 4 weeks, in groups of 3-4, create a movement-based interactive work that explores one or more modes of interaction and one or more of parameters of choreography from this course. The work can take the form of an installation or a performance. Installations can be time-based or persistent with no definitive start or end time. The only requirement is that the choreography must be interactive, meaning the performers are making choreographic decisions in real-time. This doesn’t mean there is no element of pre-set choreography, however there must be room in the choreographic structure for individual decision-making. You will have a maximum of 10 minutes to show your work. Each group will consist of 1-2 students from ITP and 1-2 students from Barnard.

## Showing: Week 12

# Course Description
This course re-conceives interactive media as a form of choreographic intervention. Instead of asking how moving bodies can control media, we will ask how interactive systems can influence movement. How do you make someone feel soft inside? How do you shake an entire room? How do you orchestrate duets between strangers?

To accomplish this, the class facilitates a semester-long collaboration between ITP students and dancers from the Barnard/Columbia Dance Department. Choreographers will learn to apply computational thinking to choreography and creative coders will learn to apply choreographic thinking to computation. To whatever extent possible, we will attempt to embody code.

Using computer vision and visual media, we will look at directing both how people move (quality of movement) as well as where they move (pathways and spatial relationships).

We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various sensing technologies available to us today. How wide is the gulf between what we can see and feel (strength, hardness, contortion) and what a computer can see and interpret (locations, contours, velocity, acceleration)? Class time will be split between movement exercises, playing with examples and deconstructing code.

The class will culminate in a final showing of student work.

All classes will take place at NYU with a separate weekly technical lab for ITP students.		  		  		  		  

## Pre-requisites
The course is intended both for anyone looking to deepen their practice in working with movement-based interaction regardless of previous experience with movement technique or programming.

As a result, there is no pre-requisite for dance and no pre-requisite for code.

## Evaluation
- 40% for showing up (on time!) and participating with curiosity and enthusiasm.
- 15% for each topic study.
- 30% for the final project.
- More than 2 unexcused absences qualifies you for a failure.
- 2 lateness of 15 minutes or more qualifies as 1 unexcused absence.

Please see ITP's statement on [Pass/Fail](http://help.itp.nyu.edu/academic-policies/pass-fail) which states that a "Pass" is equivalent to an "A" or a "B" while anything less would be considered a "Fail".

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

Attendance is mandatory. Please inform your teacher via email if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences is cause for failing the class. (An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 an absence.)

This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 40% of your grade.

Class will culminate with final projects. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world. This will comprise 20% of your grade.

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

## Statement of Principle

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.
